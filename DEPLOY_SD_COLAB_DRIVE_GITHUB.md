# Implementation Plan: Stable Diffusion Deployment on Colab with Google Drive & GitHub Workflows

---

## 1. **Project Structure & Setup**

**a. Create a GitHub Repo**
- Structure your repo for clarity and collaboration.
  ```
  /stable-diffusion-content/
    ├── notebooks/                    # Colab/Jupyter notebooks
    ├── scripts/                      # Utility scripts (e.g., batch generation)
    ├── requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
    ├── sd-config/                    # Custom configs, prompts, model settings
    ├── README.md                     # Documentation
    └── .github/workflows/            # GitHub Actions for automation
  ```

**b. Prepare Google Drive Folders**
- `/MyDrive/SD_Models/` – store models/checkpoints.
- `/MyDrive/SD_Outputs/` – generated images/videos.
- `/MyDrive/SD_Data/` – custom datasets for training/finetuning.

---

## 2. **Colab Notebook Workflow**

### a. Notebook Template (in `/notebooks/`)

- **Sections to Include:**
  1. **Google Drive Mount**
  2. **Environment Setup** (install dependencies, clone repos)
  3. **Model Download/Load** (from Drive or huggingface/SD repo)
  4. **UI Launch** (e.g., AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI) or scripted batch generation
  5. **Saving Outputs** (to Drive)
  6. **Version Logging** (push changes to GitHub)

#### Example Section Snippets:

```python
# 1. Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# 2. Clone SD WebUI
!git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
%cd stable-diffusion-webui

# 3. Symlink models from Drive
!ln -s /content/drive/MyDrive/SD_Models models

# 4. Install requirements
!pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Launch WebUI (with public URL)
!python launch.py --share

# 6. Save outputs (already configured to save to /content/drive/MyDrive/SD_Outputs)
```

---

## 3. **Dependency Management**

- **requirements.txt** should mirror the SD WebUI repo, with additional packages as needed (e.g., `torch`, `transformers`, `opencv-python`).
- Include a specific version of `torch` and other dependencies for reproducibility.

---

## 4. **Workflow Automation (GitHub Actions)**

- **Purpose:** Keep notebooks/scripts/config up-to-date; trigger CI checks; automate pulling latest models/scripts if needed.
- **Sample Workflow:** `.github/workflows/sync.yml`
  - Lint and test Python scripts.
  - Optionally, send notifications when notebooks are updated.

```yaml
name: CI Sync

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
      - '**.ipynb'
      - 'requirements.txt'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Lint scripts
        run: flake8 scripts/
```

---

## 5. **Best Practices for Content Creation**

- **Preset Prompts** and style templates in `/sd-config/`.
- **Batch Processing Scripts** for bulk generation or dataset creation.
- **Version Control:** Always commit prompt/config changes to GitHub for reproducibility.
- **Output Metadata:** Save prompts/settings with each generated image for traceability.

---

## 6. **Security & Collaboration**

- Use **GitHub Issues/Projects** to track content ideas and tasks.
- Use **Google Drive sharing** for team access to outputs/models.
- Never commit large model files to GitHub; store and version them on Drive or HuggingFace.

---

## 7. **References & Resources**

- [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
- [CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
- [Awesome Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/awesome-stable-diffusion/awesome-stable-diffusion)

---

## 8. **Scaling & Customization**

- For **team scalability**, use multiple Colab notebooks per project or experiment.
- For **custom models**, add DreamBooth/LoRA training notebooks/scripts.
- For **automation**, consider Colab Pro or local GPU servers as demand grows.

## 9. **Example Directory Tree**

```
/stable-diffusion-content/
  ├── notebooks/
  │     └── sd_colab_workflow.ipynb
  ├── scripts/
  │     └── batch_generate.py
  ├── sd-config/
  │     └── prompt_templates.yaml
  ├── requirements.txt
  ├── README.md
  └── .github/
         └── workflows/
               └── sync.yml
```

**This plan gives you a robust, reproducible, collaborative system for content creation with Stable Diffusion, leveraging the power of Colab, persistent Google Drive storage, and GitHub automation.**
